[[user-interface]]
= User interface

The simulator application is started as a Spring boot web application. Users can access an administrative web user interface
for reviewing the simulator status and listing all executed scenarios and their outcome.

The simulator user interface comes as dependency that is added to the simulator project. In Maven we somply add the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<!-- Simulator web ui -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.consol.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-simulator-ui</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.simulator.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Now you can start the simulator and open your browser pointing to the simulator UI at `http://localhost:8080`. You will see a simple
web application user interface that gives you information about the simulator.
