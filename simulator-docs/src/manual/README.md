# Citrus Simulator - Reference Documentation ![citrus-logo](images/citrus_logo.png)

## Welcome to the Citrus simulator

This is a standalone simulator application for different message transports such as Http REST APIs, SOAP WebService interface and
JMS messaging.

Clients are able to access the simulator endpoints and the simulator answers with predefined response
messages. The simulator response logic is very powerful and enables us to simulate any kind of server interface.
 
The simulator uses the test framework Citrus [www.citrusframework.org](http://www.citrusframework.org)

**NOTE:** *This project is still under construction!* 

Contributions and feedback is highly appreciated!
